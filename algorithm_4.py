# Sum and multiplication of even and odd numbers.
# You are given an array of integers. Your task is to calculate two values: the sum of all even numbers and the product of all odd numbers in the array. Please return these two values as a list [sum_even, product_odd].

# Example
# For the array [1, 2, 3, 4]:

# The sum of all even numbers is 2 + 4 = 6.
# The product of all odd numbers is 1 * 3 = 3.
# The function should return the list [6, 3].


def sum_even_and_product_odd(arr: list):

    sum_product_list =[]
    sum_even = 0
    product_odd = 1
    for i in arr:
         if i % 2 != 0:
            product_odd = i * product_odd
         else:
            sum_even = i + sum_even

    sum_product_list.append(sum_even)
    sum_product_list.append(product_odd)
    return sum_product_list
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print('The sum of even numbers and the product of odd numbers',sum_even_and_product_odd(list))

# Sum between range values
# You are given an array of integers and two integer values, min and max. Your task is to write a function that finds
# the sum of all elements in the array that fall within the range [min, max], inclusive.
#
# Example
# arr = [3, 2, 1, 4, 10, 8, 7, 6, 9, 5]
# min_val = 3
# max_val = 7
#
# Output: 25 (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7)


def sum_between_range(arr: list, min_val: int, max_val: int):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        if min_val <= num <= max_val:
            total_sum += num
    return total_sum


my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
min_value = 3
max_value = 7
print(sum_between_range(my_array ,min_value,max_value))




# Stock price 2
# You are given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
# Find the maximum profit you can achieve.
# You may complete as many transactions as you like (buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
#
# Example: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4] Return: 7

def buy_and_sell_stock(prices: list):
    max_profit = 0
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:  # Buy if the price is expected to rise
            max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
    return max_profit

# Example usage:
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
print(buy_and_sell_stock(prices))


# 4.Increment a Number
# Write a program that takes as input a list of digits encoding a non_negative decimal integer
# D and updates the list to represent the integer D + 1.
# For example, if the input is [1, 2, 9] then you should update the list to [1, 3, 0].

def plus_one(arr: list):
    # Add 1 to the last digit
    arr[-1] += 1

    # Loop through the digits in reverse order
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1): #last number, go upto fist number,
        # Check for carry-over
        if arr[i] == 10:
            arr[i] = 0
            arr[i - 1] += 1
        else:
            break  # No more carry-over, exit the loop

    # Special case: If the first digit is 10, change it to 1 and add a 0 at the end
    if arr[0] == 10:
        arr[0] = 1
        arr.append(0)

# Example usage:
input_digits = [1, 2 ,9]
plus_one(input_digits)
print(input_digits)
